Tarantula Housing
Most people make tarantulas make pets. I’m not sure if they are aware that that they are not only beautiful, majestic creatures, they are clean and easy to keep. Once you have set them up in an appropriate tarantula housing their needs are easy to fulfill. So how exactly do you create an appropriate habitat? Not all tarantulas are the same; some dwell in trees while others prefer to stay on the ground. In my research, I found so many types as well as colors of these beautiful creatures. I wanted to take advantage of the different habitat requirements and help you choose the best home for your pet. The following describes considerations to consider when housing your pet Tarantula.
I Terrarium / Enclosure / Cage
Let’s start with the material of the tarantula housing itself.
Most terrariums are made out of either plastic, acrylic, or glass. Though plastic is cheaper and more resistant, it has the tendency to become opaque over time; a problem you won’t face using a glass habitat. A nice and cheap alternative, especially if you are able to make them yourself, would be acrylic. Acrylic habitats have a number of advantages.
You can make it yourself, but also, they are a lot lighter than glass enclosures. Another benefit is ventilation, if you need to add ventilation to an acrylic habitat, it is easy to drill some extra holes. They are also very durable and won’t break as easily as a glass enclosure. They might scratch, like their plastic counterparts, but for acrylic habitats, there are a variety of products available to polish them and remove scratches. I would go with acrylic it’s easier to work with.
The size of the enclosure will depend a bit on the type of tarantula you own, for most terrestrial spiders 30x30x30 should be enough. For ground-dwelling spiders, you may want to consider much higher than that because they climb the glass and a fall might damaging their abdomen and possibly killing themselves.
The Goliath(Theraphosa Blondi), this specific spider is so large it will require a larger habitat, not higher but definitively larger, around 60×40 should do. This spider lives in tress trees you might want to opt for 20x20x4. This dweller spider make different kinds of webs, they will climb branches and will appreciate the higher enclosure.
What does most Tarantula like to eat?

This is one example of a spider dwelling place

Tliltocatl vagans

(synonym Brachypelma vagans) is a species of tarantula known commonly as the Mexican red rump. It ranges predominantly in Mexico (including the Yucatán Peninsula), but is also found in Central America.Tliltocatl vagans
They are carnivores and the adults enjoy a varied food diet of crickets, mealworms, fruit flies, roaches, and other live insects. The spiderlings, however, eat smaller foods like pinhead crickets, flightless fruit flies, and freshly hatched pinhead rusty red roaches
So these are just a few options to think about when you go to purchase your first spider. The choice is yours. These are just a few examples of spiders that caught my eye. I don’t ever think I would want to have one as a pet.
